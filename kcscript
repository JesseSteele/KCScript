# This only creates a key and csr for a domain, such as coolness.coolverbs.com or coolverbs.com or *.coolverbs.com etc
# This was written for open ssl on Debian/ Ubuntu. To install open ssl:
# apt-get install openssl
# Then, you need to do other stuff, which a gazillion tutorials can help you with.
# When you're ready to create the .key and .csr files, this script will be handy.

# Once you have openssl installed, copy the below script to a file called kcscript.
# vi kcscript
# !/bin/bash
 
#Required
domain=$1
commonname=$domain
 
#Fill-in these details:
country=US
state=Denial
locality="City Name"
organization="Awesomeorg, Inc"
organizationalunit="Information Systems Department"
email=web@myemai.verb.ink
 
#Optional but good details:
#challengpassword=
companyname="My Awesomeorg, Inc"

if [ -z "$domain" ]
then
    echo "You did not give a domain. Just start over and type it after the script command separated by a space."
    echo "Useage $0 [common name]"
 
    exit 99
fi
 
echo "Generating key request for $domain"
 
#For making the key
openssl genrsa -out $domain.key 2048
 
#For making the csr
echo "Creating CSR"
openssl req -new -key $domain.key -out $domain.csr \
    -subj "/C=$country/ST=$state/L=$locality/O=$organization/OU=$organizationalunit/CN=$commonname/emailAddress=$email/unstructuredName=$companyname/"

# Add this to the above line of arguments if you want to use the challenge password, and uncomment it in the fill-in details above:   
# challengePassword=$challengepassword
 
echo All wrapped-up, key and csr for $domain be waitin fer ye, capn.

# Be sure to make the script executable:
# chmod +x kcscript

# Rename kcscript to anything you want, such as vs...
# You can then call the script with ./kcscript and specify your domain name as an argument. For example:
# ./kcscript mynewwebserver.jamescoyle.net
# OR, if renamed
# ./vs coolio.inkisaverb.com

# That could create both the .key and .csr files, useful if you need to do a lot of them and/or want to avoid typing errors.
# Special thanks to James Coyle at www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/1073-bash-script-to-create-an-ssl-certificate-key-and-request-csr
# I had to modify this for it to work for me and wanted to put it back on the web. This Git Repo was they way.
# Cheers to openness! Fork, pull, enjoy!
